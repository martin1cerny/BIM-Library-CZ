<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; <i>LiningDepth</i> describes the length of the lining along the reveal of the door opening. It can be given by an absolute value if the door lining has a specific depth depending on the door style. However often it is equal to the wall thickness. If the same door style is used (like the same type of single swing door), but inserted into different walls with different thicknesses, it would be necessary to create a special door style for each wall thickness. Therefore several CAD systems allow to set the value to "automatically aligned" to wall thickness. This should be exchanged by leaving the optional attribute LiningDepth unassigned. The same agreement applies to <i>ThresholdDepth</i>.

                                <p>A window panel is a casement, that is, a component, fixed or opening, consisting essentially of a frame and the infilling. The
infilling of a window panel is normally glazing. The way of operation is defined in the operation type.</p>
<p>The <span class="self-ref">IfcWindowPanelProperties</span> are used to parametrically describe the shape and operation of window panels. The parametric
definition can be added solely or additionally to the explicit shape representation of the window.</p>
<p>The <strong>IfcWindowStyle</strong> can define windows consisting of more then one panel. In this case, one instance of
<span class="self-ref">IfcWindowPanelProperties</span> has to be included for each window panel. The <i>PanelPosition</i> attribute, in conjunction
with the <i>IfcWindowStyle.OperationType</i> attribute, determines to which panel the <span class="self-ref">IfcWindowPanelProperties</span>apply.</p>
<p>The <span class="self-ref">IfcWindowPanelProperties</span> are included in the list of properties (<i>HasPropertySets</i>) of the
<strong>IfcWindowStyle</strong>. More information about the window panel can be included in the same list of the <strong>IfcWindowStyle</strong>
using the <strong>IfcPropertySet</strong> for dynamic extensions.</p>




<p class="use-head">Geometry use definitions</p>
<p>The <span class="self-ref">IfcWindowPanelProperties</span> does not hold an own geometric representation. However it defines parameter, which can
be used to create the shape of the <strong>IfcWindowType</strong> (which is inserted by the <strong>IfcWindow</strong> into the spatial context of
the project).</p>
<p>The parameters at the <span class="self-ref">IfcWindowPanelProperties</span> define a standard window panel. The outer boundary of the panel is
determined by the occurrence parameter assigned to the IfcWindow, which inserts the IfcWindowStyle. It has to take the lining
parameter into account as well. The position of the window panel within the overall window is determined by the
<i>PanelPosition</i> attribute.</p>

<p>As shown in 
The following parameter apply to that panel: <i>FrameDepth</i>, <i>FrameThickness</i>.</p>

A window style defines the overall parameter of the window style and refers to the particular parameter of the lining and one (or several) panels through <strong>IfcWindowLiningProperties</strong> and <strong>IfcWindowPanelProperties</strong>.</p>

<p>The window entity (<strong>IfcWindow</strong>) defines a particular occurrence of a window inserted in the spatial context of a project. The actual parameter of the window and/or its shape is defined at the <span class="self-ref">IfcWindowStyle</span>, to which the <strong>IfcWindow</strong> related by the inverse relationship <i>IsDefinedBy</i> pointing to <strong>IfcRelDefinesByType</strong>. The <span class="self-ref">IfcWindowStyle</span> also defines the particular attributes for the lining (<strong>IfcWindowLiningProperties</strong>) and panels (<strong>IfcWindowPanelProperties</strong>).</p>

<p>The <span class="self-ref">IfcWindowStyle</span> defines the baseline geometry, or the representation map, for all occurrences of the window style,
given by the IfcWindow, pointing to this style. The representation of the window style may be given by the agreed set
of minimal parameters, defined for the window lining and the window panel(s), or it may be given by a geometric representation
used by the <strong>IfcRepresentationMap</strong>. The attribute <i>ParameterTakesPrecedence</i> decides, whether the set of
parameters can be used to exactly represent the shape of the window style (TRUE), or whether the attached <strong>IfcRepresentationMap</strong> holds the exact representation (FALSE).</p>

<p>The <i>IfcWindowStyleOperationTypeEnum</i> defines the general layout of the window style. Depending on the enumerator, the
appropriate instances of <strong>IfcWindowLiningProperties</strong> and <strong>IfcWindowPanelProperties</strong> are attached in the list of
<i>HasPropertySets</i>. See geometry use definitions there.</p>

      EXAMPLE&nbsp; 
      applied to a property within a property set. For simplicity,
      only the mandatory attributes are shown as asserted. It shows
      how a property 'ThingWeight' which has a nominal value of
      19.5 kg has two constraints that are logically aggregated by
      an AND connection. One of the constraints has a benchmark of
      'GREATERTHANOREQUALTO' whilst the second has a benchmark of
      'LESSTHANOREQUALTO'. This means that the constraint must lie
      between these two bounding values. The relating constraint is
      instantiated as an objective named as 'Weight Constraint' and
      qualified as a SPECIFICATION constraint. The two related
      constraints are both specified as metrics since they can have
      specific values.

Instances of any subtype of <strong>IfcProduct</strong> may be assigned to the 
equipment resource using <strong>IfcRelAssignsToResource</strong> in order to 
characterize the equipment further, as described at the supertype

<p>The purpose of an <span class="self-ref">IfcLaborResource</span> is to identify a skillset that may be required or used. The skillset identified may be (for instance) charge-hand, foreman, labourer, plumbers mate etc. and provides a designation of a particular level of skill. It can be used to identify the generic type of labour resource that is required for a purpose without having to be specific about the actor (person or organization) providing the resource occurrence. It may be particularly useful when creating an overall plan for a process or processes. For instance, within maintenance or work planning there may be a known task that needs to be done which is planned to require a 'chargehand pipe fitter'. There may be several such labour resources available and so the need to identify which will be used is not necessary at the planning stage.</p>

<p>At a later stage, individual actors can be determined for the labour resources. This is achieved through specifying the actor through <strong>IfcActor</strong>.

<p>The extent of the <span class="self-ref">IfcAppliedValue</span> is determined by the <i>AppliedValue</i> attribute which may be defined either as an <strong>IfcMeasureWithUnit</strong> or as an <strong>IfcMonetaryMeasure</strong> or as an <strong>IfcRatioMeasure</strong> via the <strong>IfcAppliedValueSelect</strong> type. </p> 

<p>Optionally, an <span class="self-ref">IfcAppliedValue</span> may have an applicable date. This is intended to fix the date on which the value became relevant for use.

Similarly, an <span class="self-ref">IfcAppliedValue</span> may have a 'fixed until' date. This is intended to fix the date on which the value ceases to be relevant for use.</p> 

<p>An instance of <span class="self-ref">IfcAppliedValue</span> may have a unit basis asserted.  This is defined as an <strong>IfcMeasureWithUnit</strong> that determines the extent of the unit value for application purposes. It is assumed that when this attribute is asserted, then the value given to <span class="self-ref">IfcAppliedValue</span> is that for unit quantity.

A classification in the sense of <span class="self-ref">IfcClassification</span> is taxonomy, or taxonomic scheme, arranged in a hierarchical structure. A category of objects relates to other categories in a generalization-specialization relationship. Therefore the classification items in an classification are organized in a tree structure.</p>

<p>The <span class="self-ref">IfcClassification</span> identifies the classification system or source to which a classification reference refers to.

<p>There are two methods to define and reference a classification system:</p>
<ol>
<li>Including the classification system structure within the dataset: Here a hierarchical tree of <strong>IfcClassificationReference</strong>'s is included that defines the classification system including the relationship between the classification items. The <i>ReferencedSource</i> attribute of <strong>IfcClassificationReference</strong> links the classification item to the parent item, and the parent item finally to the <span class="self-ref">IfcClassification</span>.</li>
<li>Referencing the classification system by a classification key or id: Here the <strong>IfcClassificationReference</strong> is used to assign a classification id or key as <i>Identification</i> attribute and it may link by <i>ReferencedSource</i> attribute directly to the <span class="self-ref">IfcClassification</span>.</li>
</ol>




<h1>IfcClassificationReference</h1>
                                
                                <p>An <span class="self-ref">IfcClassificationReference</span> is a reference into a classification system or source (see <strong>IfcClassification</strong>) for a specific classification key (or notation).</p>

<p>The inherited attributes have the following meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Identification</i>: holds the key provided for a specific references to classification items (or tables).</li>
<li><i>Name</i>: allows for a human interpretable designation of a classification notation.</li>
<li><i>Location</i>: optionally holds a direct URI link into the classification system (or source) to hyperlink the classification key.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <span class="self-ref">IfcClassificationReference</span> can either be assigned directly to the <strong>IfcClassification</strong>, such as if no classification hierarchy has to be included, or it references the parent classification notation, if the fully classification hierarchy is included in the data set. The first is refered to as "lightweight classification", and the second as "full classification". The attribute <i>ReferencedSource</i> then holds the following information (choice by <strong>IfcClassificationReferenceSelect</strong>):</p>
<ol>
<li>being of type <strong>IfcClassification</strong>: direct reference to the classification system (with meta information provided);</li>
<li>being of type <span class="self-ref">IfcClassificationReference</span>: reference to the parent classification notation within the classification hierarchy.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote class="example">
EXAMPLE&nbsp; The <span class="self-ref">IfcClassificationReference</span> can be used as a form of 'lightweight' classification through the '<i>Identification</i>' attribute inherited from the abstract <strong>IfcExternalReference</strong> class. In this case, the '<i>Identification</i>' could take (for instance) the Uniclass notation "L6814" which, if the classification was well understood by all parties and was known to be taken from a particular classification source, would be sufficient. The <i>Name</i> attribute could be the title "Tanking". This would remove the need for the overhead of the more complete classification structure of the model.</p>

<blockquote class="extDef">NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
A Boolean result is the result of a regularized operation on two solids to create a new solid. Valid operations are
regularized union, regularized intersection, and regularized difference. For purpose of Boolean operations, a solid is
considered to be a regularized set of points. The final Boolean result depends upon the operation and the two operands.
In the case of the difference operator the order of the operands is also significant. The operator can be either union,
intersection or difference. The effect of these operators is described below:
<ul style="font-size:inherit;">
<li style="font-size:inherit;">Union on two solids is the new solid that is the regularization of the set of all points
that are in either the first operand or the second operand or in both.</li>
<li style="font-size:inherit;">Intersection on two solids is the new solid that is the regularization of the set of all
points that are in both the first operand and the second operand.</li>
<li style="font-size:inherit;">The result of the difference operation on two solids is the regularization of the set of
all points which are in the first operand, but not in the second operand.</li>

by an implicit cartesian transformation operator at the start point of the sweep, where the profile normal agrees
to the tangent of the directrix at this point, and the profile's x-axis agrees to the <i>FixedReference</i> direction. The orientation of the curve during the sweeping operation is controlled by the <i>FixedReference</i> direction.</p>

<p>The <i>SweptArea</i> is swept along the <i>Directrix</i> in such a way that the origin of the local coordinate system 
used to define the <i>SweptArea</i> is on the <i>Directrix</i> and the local X axis is in the direction of the projection of

<p>The <i>Directrix</i> and the <i>ReferenceSurface</i> are positioned within the object coordinate system. The start
of the sweeping operation is at the <i>StartParam</i>, the parameter value is provided based on the curve parameterization.
If no <i>StartParam</i> is provided the start defaults to the begin of the directrix. The end of the sweeping operation is 
at the <i>EndParam</i>, the parameter value is provided based on the curve parameterization. If no <i>EndParam</i> is provided 
the end defaults to the end of the directrix.</p>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The <i>StartParam</i> and the <i>EndParam</i> are not normalized by default, they depend
upon the parameterization of the curve. However using the <strong>IfcReparametrisedCompositeCurveSegment</strong> within an 
<strong>IfcCompositeCurve</strong> as the directrix allows to explicitly reparameterize the underlying sweeping curve.

<blockquote class="example">
EXAMPLE&nbsp; The reference surface is any surface (plane, cylindric, composite) situated in 3D space and positioned in the object 
coordinate system. In many cases, it is a surface of extrusion. The directrix lies on the surface, often defined as a p-curve at
this reference surface. At any point of the directrix, a plane can be constructed. The origin of the position coordinate system
lies at the directrix. The Axis3 (the z-axis, or normal) of the position coordinate system is identical to the tangent of the directrix at this point, the Axis1 (the x axis, or u) of the position coordinate system is identical to the <i>FixedReference</i> 
direction. The Axis2 (the y axis, or v) is constructed. In this case the resulting swept solid is not repositioned.

A manifold solid b-rep is a finite, arcwise connected volume bounded by one or more surfaces, each of which is a

domain of a face does not include its boundaries. The embedded graph may be disconnected and may be a pseudo graph. The
graph is labeled; that is, each entity in the graph has a unique identity. The geometric surface definition used to

by an implicit cartesian transformation operator at the start point of the sweep, where the profile normal agrees
to the tangent of the directrix at this point, and the profile's x-axis agrees to the surface normal. At any point
along the directrix, the swept profile origin lies on the directrix, the profile's normal points towards the tangent

<blockquote class="note">

<p>The <i>Directrix</i> and the <i>ReferenceSurface</i> are positioned within the object coordinate system. The start

the end defaults to the end of the directrix. The geometric shape of the solid is not dependent upon the curve parameterization;
the volume depends upon the area swept and the length of the <i>Directrix</i>.</p>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The <i>StartParam</i> and the <i>EndParam</i> are not normalized by default, they depend
upon the parameterization of the curve. However using the <strong>IfcReparametrisedCompositeCurveSegment</strong> within an

be defined as a polyline or composite curve, in case of a cylindrical or other non-planer reference surface it might often be defined as a 
p-curve on this reference surface. </blockquote>
<p>At any point of the directrix, a plane can be constructed. The origin of the position coordinate system of the implicit plane
lies at the directrix. The Axis3 (the z-axis, or normal) of the position coordinate system is identical to the tangent of the directrix

implied a priori by the assignment.</li>
<li><b>Association to external resources</b> - an association
relationship (<strong>IfcRelAssociates</strong>) that refers to external
sources of information (most notably a classification or document)
and creates a uni-directional association. There is no dependency
implied by the association.</li>
<li><b>Aggregation of other objects</b> - an aggregation
relationship (<strong>IfcRelAggregates</strong>) that establishes an
unordered, spatial whole/part relation and creates a bi-directional
relation. There is an implied dependency established.</li>
<li><b>Nesting of other objects</b> - a nesting relationship
(<strong>IfcRelNests</strong>) that establishes an ordered, non-spatial
whole/part relation and creates a bi-directional relation. There is
an implied dependency established.</li>
<li><b>Declaration within a context</b> - a relationship
(<strong>IfcRelDeclares</strong>) of the uppermost object definition within
the object definition tree (e.g. the summary object within an
object nesting tree) to the context (a project or project library).
It applies the units, representation context and other context
information to this object definition and all dependent ones.

                                <p>The objectified relationship <span class="self-ref">IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor</span> is a specialization of the general grouping mechanism. It allows to add a factor to define the ratio that applies to the assignment of object definitions (individual object occurrences as subtypes of <strong>IfcObject</strong> and object types as subtypes of <strong>IfcTypeObject</strong>) to a group (subtypes of <strong>IfcGroup</strong>).</p>

<p>The ratio can be used to define a percentage assignment.  For example, a <i>Factor</i> of 0.8 would indicate that the object is assigned by 80% to the group, or a <i>Factor</i> of 2.5 would indicate the object is assigned with a weight factor of 2.5 to the group.</p> 

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; Examples of factored groups include the assignment of load cases in a load combination in structural analysis, or the assignment of spaces by percentage to different rental zones.
</blockquote>

<p>The same object or object type may be included with the same or different <i>Factor</i> values to many groups. Grouping relationships are not hierarchical.</p>

                                <p>The objectified relationship <span class="self-ref">IfcRelAssignsToProcess</span> handles the assignment of one or many objects to a process or activity. An object can be a product that is the item the process operates on. Processes and activities can operate on things other than products, and can operate in ways other than input and output.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
EXAMPLE&nbsp; It may be common to define processes
during estimating or scheduling that describe design tasks
(resulting in documents), procurement tasks (resulting in
construction materials), planning tasks (resulting in processes),
etc. Furthermore, the ways in which process can operate on
something might include "installs", "finishes", "transports",
"removes", etc. The ways are described as operation
types.
</blockquote>

<p>The inherited attribute <i>RelatedObjects</i> gives the
references to the objects, or object type, which the process
operates on. The <i>RelatingProcess</i> is the process or process
type, that operates on the object. The operation types are
captured in the inherited attribute <i>Name</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; The agreement on valid and recognizable
values for the <i>Name</i> attribute is part of view definitions
and implementer agreements.

                                <p>The objectified relationship <span class="self-ref">IfcRelAssignsToProduct</span> handles the assignment of objects (subtypes of <strong>IfcObject</strong>) to a product (subtypes of <strong>IfcProduct</strong>). The <i>Name</i> attribute should be used to classify the usage of the <span class="self-ref">IfcRelAssignsToProduct</span> objectified relationship. The following <i>Name</i> values are proposed:</p>
<ul>
<li>'Context' : Assignment of a context specific representation, such as of structural members to a different context representation (with potentially different decomposition breakdown) such as of building elements for a specific context specific representation. </li>
<li>'View' : Assignment of a product (via <i>RelatingProduct</i>) that is decomposed according to a discipline view, to another product (via <i>RelatedObjects</i>) that is decomposed according to a different discipline view. An example is the assignment of the architectural slab to a different decomposition of the pre manufactured sections of a slab (under a precast concrete discipline view).</li>

                                <p>The objectified relationship <span class="self-ref">IfcRelAssignsToResource</span> handles the assignment of objects
(as subtypes of <strong>IfcObject</strong>), acting as a resource usage or consumption, to a resource (as subtypes of <strong>IfcResource</strong>).</p>

<blockquote class="example">
EXAMPLE&nbsp; The assignment of a resource usage to a construction resource is an application of this generic relationship. It could be an actor, as person or organization assigned to a labor resource, or a raw product assigned to a construction product or material resource).

                                <p>
 The association relationship <span class="self-ref">IfcRelAssociates</span> refers to sources of information (most notably a 
 classification, library, document, approval, contraint, or material). The information associated may reside 
 internally or externally of the project data. There is no dependency implied by the association.
</p>
<blockquote class="example">
 EXAMPLE&nbsp; Further external information may be provided to the tank equipment (as subtype of <strong>IfcProduct</strong>) 
 in terms of its classification and instruction documents, the source of the additional information is held external 
 to the project data model.
</blockquote>
<p>
 Association relationships can be established to objects (occurrences as subtypes of <strong>IfcObject</strong>) or to types 
 (as subtypes of <strong>IfcTypeObject</strong>). Some associations (such as approval, or document) may also be applied to
 property templates (as subtypes of <strong>IfcPropertyDefinition</strong>).
</p>
<blockquote class="example">
 EXAMPLE&nbsp; The classification information for the storage tank equipment may be associated to the
 <strong>IfcTankType</strong> (subtype of <strong>IfcTypeObject</strong>), defining the specific information for all occurencies of
 that tank in the project. Therefore the association of the Uniclass notation 'L6814' may be associated by a
 subtype of <span class="self-ref">IfcRelAssociates</span> to the type information.
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="example">
 EXAMPLE&nbsp; The classification information for a particular space within a building may be associated
 to the <strong>IfcSpace</strong> object (subtype of <strong>IfcObject</strong>), defining a particular occurrence of
 space. Therefore the association of the DIN notation 'NF 1.5' may be associated by a subtype of
 <span class="self-ref">IfcRelAssociates</span> to the object.
</blockquote>
<p>
 The association relationship establishs an association between one to many objects or property templates and the
 associated information. The subtypes of <span class="self-ref">IfcRelAssociates</span> establish the particular semantic meaning of the  association relationship.

classification item (items of the select
<strong>IfcClassificationSelect</strong>) to objects occurrences (subtypes of
<strong>IfcObject</strong>) or object types (subtypes of
<strong>IfcTypeObject</strong>).</p>
<p>The relationship is used to assign a classification item, or a
classification system itself to objects. Depending on the type of
the <i>RelatingClassification</i> it is either:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reference to an classification item within an external
classification system, or</li>
<li>a reference to the classification system itself</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; The reference to a classification item
includes a link to the classification system within which the item
is declared. It assigns the meaning of the classification item to
the object (ocurrence or type). The reference to the classification
system provides the information that the object (occurrence or
type) is governed by the classification system but no assignment of
a particular items has been done yet.
</blockquote>

<p>The inherited attribute <i>RelatedObjects</i> define the objects
or object types to which the classification is applied. The
attribute <i>RelatingClassification</i> is the reference to a

<p>There are two different types of relationships, 1-to-1 relationships and 1-to-many relationship. used within the subtypes of <span class="self-ref">IfcRelationship</span>. The following convention applies to all subtypes:</p> 

<ul> 
<li>The two sides of the objectified relationship are named <br>- Relating+&lt;name of relating object&gt; and <br>- Related+&lt;name of related object&gt;</li>

As a general connectivity it does not imply constraints, however subtypes of the relationship define the applicable object types for the connectivity relationship and the semantics of the particular connectivity.</p> 

 

<h1>IfcRelDeclares</h1>
                                
                                <p>The objectified relationship <span class="self-ref">IfcRelDeclares</span> handles the declaration of objects (subtypes of <strong>IfcObject</strong>) or properties (subtypes of <strong>IfcPropertyDefinition</strong>) to a project or project library (represented by <strong>IfcProject</strong>, or <strong>IfcProjectLibrary</strong>).</p>

<p>The relationship handles the assignment of other objects, like <strong>IfcActor</strong>, or <strong>IfcTypeObject</strong> to the project, or project libary. The attribute <i>RelatedDefinitions</i> provides the references to the first level objects, that are the elements within the context. All other objects that relate to the first level objects are also defined in the context.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; Every object (as subtype of <strong>IfcObject</strong>) has to be declared within the context of a single <strong>IfcProject</strong>, or of a <strong>IfcProjectLibrary</strong> assigned to a single <strong>IfcProject</strong>. This declaration is transitive. For example: the <strong>IfcWorkPlan</strong> as first level object is declared within the context of <strong>IfcProject</strong> via <span class="self-ref">IfcRelDeclares</span>, all related <strong>IfcWorkSchedule</strong>'s are related to the context in a transitive way through <strong>IfcWorkPlan</strong>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; The assignment excludes subtypes of <strong>IfcProduct</strong>'s, these are assigned to the <strong>IfcProject</strong> using the spatial structure approach through <strong>IfcSpatialStructureElement</strong>(s), where the outer container element such as <strong>IfcSite</strong> or <strong>IfcBuilding</strong> has an <strong>IfcRelAggregates</strong> relationship with the <strong>IfcProject</strong>.

<h1>IfcRelDecomposes</h1>
                                
                                <p>The decomposition relationship,
<span class="self-ref">IfcRelDecomposes</span>, defines the general concept of elements
being composed or decomposed. The decomposition relationship
denotes a whole/part hierarchy with the ability to navigate from
the whole (the composition) to the parts and vice versa.</p>
<p>Decompositions may be constrained by requiring both, the whole
and its parts, to be of the same type - thus establishing a
nesting relationship. Or they may require some form of physical
containment, thus establishing special types of aggregation
relationships.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; There are two special names for
decomposition, which are linguistically distinguished, nesting
and aggregation. The subtypes of <span class="self-ref">IfcRelDecomposes</span> will
introduce either the nesting or aggregation convention (see
<strong>IfcRelNests</strong> and <strong>IfcRelAggregates</strong>).
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="example">
EXAMPLE&nbsp; A cost element is a nest of other cost
elements. Or a structural frame is an aggregation of beams and
columns. Both are applications of decomposition
relationship.
</blockquote>
<p>Decompositions imply a dependency, i.e. the definition of the
whole depends on the definition of the parts and the parts depend
on the existence of the whole. The decomposition relationship can
be applied in a recursive manner, i.e. a decomposed element can
be part in another decomposition. Cyclic references have to be
prevented at application level.</p>

      The nesting relationship <span class="self-ref">IfcRelNests</span> is a special type
      of the general composition/decomposition (or whole/part)
      relationship <strong>IfcRelDecomposes</strong>. The nesting
      relationship can be applied to all non physical subtypes of
      object and object types, namely processes, controls (like
      cost items), and resources. It can also be applied to
      physical subtypes of object and object types, namely elements
      having ports. The nesting implies an order among the nested
      parts.

    <blockquote class="example">

<li>Texture nodes that require support for the PNG image format shall interpret the PNG pixel formats in the following way:
<ol type="a">
<li>Greyscale pixels without alpha or simple transparency are treated as intensity textures.</li>
<li>Greyscale pixels with alpha or simple transparency are treated as intensity plus alpha textures.</li>
<li>RGB pixels without alpha channel or simple transparency are treated as full RGB textures.</li>
<li>RGB pixels with alpha channel or simple transparency are treated as full RGB plus alpha textures.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the image specifies colours as indexed-colour (that is, palettes or colourmaps), the following semantics should be used (note that `greyscale' refers to a palette entry with equal red, green, and blue values):
<ol type="a">
<li>If all the colours in the palette are greyscale and there is no transparency chunk, it is treated as an intensity texture.</li>
<li>If all the colours in the palette are greyscale and there is a transparency chunk, it is treated as an intensity plus opacity texture.</li>
<li>&gt;If any colour in the palette is not grey and there is no transparency chunk, it is treated as a full RGB texture.</li>
<li>If any colour in the palette is not grey and there is a transparency chunk, it is treated as a full RGB plus alpha texture.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Texture nodes that require support for JPEG files shall interpret JPEG files as follows:
<ol type="a">
<li>Greyscale files (number of components equals 1) are treated as intensity textures.</li>
<li>YCbCr files are treated as full RGB textures.</li>
<li>No other JPEG file types are required. It is recommended that other JPEG files are treated as a full RGB textures.</li>
</ol>

</p>
<p>The per-property matching rules
from (2) above are as follows:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>'font-style' is tried first.
'italic'
will be satisfied if there is either a face in the UA's font database
labeled with the CSS keyword 'italic' (preferred) or 'oblique'.
Otherwise the values must be matched exactly or font-style will fail. </li>
  <li>'font-variant' is tried
next. 'normal'
matches a font not labeled as 'small-caps'; 'small-caps' matches (1) a
font labeled as 'small-caps', (2) a font in which the small caps are
synthesized, or (3) a font where all lowercase letters are replaced by
upper case letters. A small-caps font may be synthesized by
electronically scaling uppercase letters from a normal font. </li>
  <li>'font-weight' is matched next, it will never fail. (See 'font-weight' below.) </li>
  <li>'font-size' must be matched within a
UA-dependent margin of tolerance. (Typically, sizes for scalable fonts
are rounded to the nearest whole pixel, while the tolerance for
bitmapped fonts could be as large as 20%.) Further computations, are
based on the 'font-size' value that is used, not the one that is specified.</li>

      vertical coordinate T. If the texture map is repeated in a
      given direction (S-axis or T-axis), a texture coordinate C (s
      or t) is mapped into a texture map that has N pixels in the
      given direction as follows:

      <span class="self-ref">IfcRelSequence</span> is a
      sequential relationship between processes where one process
      must occur before the other in time and where the timing of
      the relationship may be described as a type of sequence.
      The relating process
      (<i>IfcRelSequence.RelatingProcess</i>) is considered to be
      the predecessor in the relationship (has precedence) whilst
      the related process (<i>IfcRelSequence.RelatedProcess</i>)
      is the successor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="self-ref">IfcRelSequence</span> is defined as one-to-one
      relationship; therefore it assigns one predecessor to one
      successor.
    </p>
    
    
    <p class="use-head">Use definitions</p>
    <p>
      <span class="self-ref">IfcRelSequence</span> is used to describe the logical
      sequence relationship that exists between two processes.
      This logical relationship identifies that there is a
      predecessor or relating process and a successor or related
      process. In IFC, there may be one predecessor and one
      successor in the relationship. Many occurrences of
      <span class="self-ref">IfcRelSequence</span> may exist to describe the sequence
      relationships of a predecessor task with many successor
      tasks or of many predecessor tasks with one successor task,
      thus enabling a m:n sequence relationship between tasks.
      Please note that sequence relationships can be used to define 
      dependencies between process occurrences but also between 
      process types (for further information see <strong>IfcRelDefinesByObject</strong> 
      and <strong>IfcTaskType</strong>). In case of defining dependencies between 
      process occurrences sequence relationships should stay 
      within the limits of a directed, non-cyclic graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sequence type may be set for a sequence. For tasks
      assigned to a work schedule, it is expected that the
      sequence type will be asserted. For a process map, where
      the sequence relationship between processes is simply a
      logical flow, it need not be asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A time lag may be assigned to a sequence, and the sequence
      type defines the way in which the time lag applies to the
      sequence either as a ratio or percentage of time duration
      (e.g. start successor task when predecessor is 50%
      complete) or as a time measure (e.g. start successor task 1
      week after commencement of the predecessor task). Care
      should be used when assigning a time lag to a sequence
      depending on the setting of the sequence type since there
      is no checking that the time lag value is in keeping with
      the sequence type set.

design, construction and operation related activities as well.</p>

      (<i>IfcProcess.LongDescription</i>). A work method may be

      requirement of fulfilling their needs. The actual task
      represented by the <span class="self-ref">IfcTask</span> entity is turning a
      request into an order and initiating the action that will
      enable the order to be completed. The
      <strong>IfcProjectOrder</strong> or one of its subtypes including
      maintenance work order, is related to the <span class="self-ref">IfcTask</span>

<ul>
      <li>Move from: The place from which actors and their

<p>The definition of time periods can be derived from a base calendar and/or modified/defined by a set of working times and non-working exception times. All time periods defined by <i>IfcWorkCalendar.ExceptionTimes</i> override the time periods inherited from the base calendar (base calendar is defined as the next applicable calendar for the task or resource). Thus, exception times replace the working times from the base calendar.</p>

      An annotation is a graphical representation within the geometric (and spatial) context

</p>
<ul>
 <li>linear elements such as sections of a roadway (including carriageway/pavement, verge, median, marker line, kerb etc.);</li>

                                <p>An element is a generalization of all components
that make up an AEC product. Those elements can be logically
contained by a spatial structure element that constitutes a
certain level within a project structure hierarchy (site,
building, storey or space). This is done by using the
<strong>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</strong> relationship.</p>
<p>Elements are physically existent objects, although they might
be void elements, such as holes. Elements either remain
permanently in the AEC product, or only temporarily, as formwork
does. Elements can be either assembled on site or
pre-manufactured and built in on site.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
EXAMPLE&nbsp; Examples of elements in a building
construction context are walls, floors, windows and
recesses.
</blockquote>

<p>An element can have material and quantity information assigned
through the <strong>IfcRelAssociatesMaterial</strong> and
<strong>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</strong> relationship.</p>
<p>In addition an element can be declared to be a specific
occurrence of an element type (and thereby be defined by the
element type properties) using the <strong>IfcRelDefinesByType</strong>
relationship.</p>
<p>An element can also be defined as an element assembly that is
a group of semantically and topologically related elements that
form a higher level part of the AEC product. Those element
assemblies are defined by virtue of the <strong>IfcRelAggregates</strong>
relationship.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
EXAMPLE&nbsp; Examples for element assembly are complete Roof Structures, made by several Roof Areas, or a Stair,
composed by Flights and Landings.

<p class="use-head">Feature Catalog Use Definition</p>
    <p>
      Geographic element types are frequently identified in feature
      catalogs that are produced for particular purposes. The
      <span class="self-ref">IfcGeographicElementType</span> entity enables the continued
      use of existing feature catalogs through capture of their
      identity and attributes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information from feature catalogs might be captured in
      various ways:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>via property sets, some of which will be specifically
      defined within the IFC property set catalog whilst others
      will be created for local use; this is the form of capture
      that is expected to be most widely used
      </li>
      <li>through use of the IFC classification model whereby
      features might be identified through an
      <strong>IfcClassificationReference</strong> with additional
      description; in which case, any further attributes required
      would still need to be captured in property sets.

providing an interference geometry.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the interference geometry is available it can be passed

as a point, curve, surface, or volume within the local placement
coordinate systems of the connecting elements. The
<strong>IfcConnectionVolumeGeometry</strong> is the default type to be used
for interference in 3D space, as indicated in e.g. clash

<li><i>ImpliedOrder</i>=TRUE  The <i>RelatingElement</i>
constitutes the primary element of the interference relationship.
If the interference is to be resolved by subtracting the
overlapping part, it should be subtracted from the

interference relationships where the <i>RelatedElement</i>
creates a void in the <i>RelatingElement</i> dynamically.</li>

building element or spaces on the other side.</li>
<li>2<sup><small>nd</small></sup> level space boundary: defined

the other side into account. It can be further distinguished into
<ul>
<li>2<sup><small>nd</small></sup> level type A: There is a space

                                <p>The <span class="self-ref">IfcMirroredProfileDef</span> defines the profile by mirroring the parent profile about the y axis of the parent profile coordinate system. That is, left and right of the parent profile are swapped.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p><span class="self-ref">IfcMirroredProfileDef</span> is primarily useful together with
<strong>IfcCShapeProfileDef</strong>, <strong>IfcLShapeProfileDef</strong>,
<strong>IfcUShapeProfileDef</strong>, or <strong>IfcZShapeProfileDef</strong> as
parent profile but can be used with other parent profile types as well.</p>

<p>Mirroring of an <strong>IfcParameterizedProfileDef</strong> is performed after
translation and rotation according to its <i>Position</i> attribute.
For example, if the parent profile's <i>Position</i> offsets it by half
of its width to the right, then the mirrored profile will be offset by
half of its width to the left.</p>

<p>Mirroring about the x axis, i.e. swapping top and bottom, can be
achieved by mirroring about the y axis coupled with 180 degree rotation
about the z axis.
In general, rotation happens in a containing object such as
<strong>IfcSweptAreaSolid</strong>, i.e. after mirroring by <span class="self-ref">IfcMirroredProfileDef</span>
was performed.
If the parent profile is an <strong>IfcParameterizedProfileDef</strong>, rotation
can alternatively happen already in the parent profile by means of its
<i>Position</i> attribute, i.e. before mirroring by <span class="self-ref">IfcMirroredProfileDef</span>
was performed.</p>



<h1>IfcParameterizedProfileDef</h1>
                                
                                <p>The parameterized profile definition
defines a 2D position coordinate system to which the parameters of the
different profiles relate to. All profiles are defined centric to the
origin of the position coordinate system, or more specific, the origin
[0.,0.] shall be in the center of the bounding box of the profile.</p>

<p>The <i>Position</i> attribute of <span class="self-ref">IfcParameterizedProfileDef</span>
is used to position the profile within the XY plane of the underlying
coordinate system of the swept surface geometry, the swept area
solid or the sectioned spine. It can be used to position the profile at
any point which becomes the origin [0.,0.,0.] of the extruded
or rotated surface or solid.</p>

<p>The <i>Position</i> attribute should not be used if the transformation
can be specified in a containing object instead.  In particular, this
applies if the <span class="self-ref">IfcParameterizedProfileDef</span> is referenced as
<i>SweptArea</i> in subtypes of <strong>IfcSweptAreaSolid</strong> or as
<i>CrossSections</i> in <strong>IfcSectionedSpine</strong>.</p>

<p>Several subtypes of <span class="self-ref">IfcParameterizedProfileDef</span> provide
shape parameters which are optional. Sending systems should always
provide values for these parameters if possible. If these parameters
are left unspecified, receiving systems may retrieve values for them
by external reference (if a reference to an external document or library
is given; see guidance at <strong>IfcProfileDef</strong>), or estimate them, or
simply assume zero values.</p>









<h1>IfcProfileDef</h1>
                                
                                <p><span class="self-ref">IfcProfileDef</span>
is the supertype of all definitions of standard and arbitrary profiles
within IFC. It is used to define a standard set of commonly used
section profiles by their parameters or by their explicit curve geometry.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Parameterized profiles are 2D primitives, which are used within the industry to describe cross
  sections by a description of its parameters.</li>
  <li>Arbitrary profiles are cross
  sections defined by an outer boundary as bounded curve, which may also
  include holes, defined by inner boundaries.</li>
  <li>Derived profiles, based on a
  transformation of a parent profile, are also part of the profile
  definitions available.</li>
  <li>In addition composite
  profiles can be defined, which include two or more profile definitions
  to define the resulting profile.</li>
</ul>






<p><b>Use in material association</b></p>

<p>Beams, columns, and similarly shaped building elements and their type objects may
be associated with a section profile definition, combined with material definition,
by means of <strong>IfcRelAssociatesMaterial</strong> together with <strong>IfcMaterialProfileSet</strong>
and <strong>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</strong>. This way, building elements and element types
with same section and material can share a common section profile definition and
association.</p>

<p>The profile definition in material association is required to be consistent with
shape representations of the respective building elements.</p>

<p>A higher-level description of spatial aligment of the section profile of a member
(such as centered, bottom-left, in the geometric centroid, and more) can be provided
within <strong>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</strong> by means of a cardinal point reference.
This can be used redundant to geometric data in order to convey design intent.</p>


<p><b>Use in shape models</b></p>

<p>Profile definitions are used within the geometry and geometric model
resource to create either swept surfaces, swept area solids, or
sectioned spines.</p>

<p>The purpose of the profile
definition within the swept surfaces or swept area solids is to define
a uniform cross section being swept:</p>

<ul>
  <li>along a line (extrusion) using <strong>IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion</strong> or <strong>IfcExtrudedAreaSolid</strong></li>
  <li>along a circular arc (revolution) using <strong>IfcSurfaceOfRevolution</strong> or <strong>IfcRevolvedAreaSolid</strong></li>
  <li>along a directrix lying on a reference surface using <strong>IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of the profile
definition within the sectioned spine is to define a varying cross
sections at several positions along a spine curve. The subtype <strong>IfcDerivedProfileDef</strong>
is particularly suited to provide the consecutive profiles to be based
on transformations of the start profile and thus maintaining the
identity of vertices and edges.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; Subtypes of the <span class="self-ref">IfcProfileDef</span>
contain parameterized profiles (as subtypes of <strong>IfcParameterizedProfileDef</strong>)
which establish their own 2D position coordinate system, profiles given
by explicit curve geometry (either open or closed profiles) and two
special types for composite profiles and derived profiles, based on a
2D Cartesian transformation.
</blockquote>

<p>An <span class="self-ref">IfcProfileDef</span>
is treated as bounded area if it is used within swept area solids. In
this case, the inside of the profile is part of the profile. The
attribute <i>ProfileType</i> is set to AREA. An <span class="self-ref">IfcProfileDef</span>
is treated as a curve if it is used within swept surfaces. In this
case, the inside of the profile (if the curve is closed) is not part of
the profile. The attribute <i>ProfileType</i>
is set to CURVE.</p>

      The coordinate operation is an
      abstract supertype to handle any operation (transformation
      or conversion) between two coordinate reference systems. It
      is meant to provide expandability for future versions,
      since currently only the conversion of a local engineering
      coordinate system into a map coordinate reference system is
      dealt with by the subtype <strong>IfcMapConversion</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By convention, a coordinate operation is given between the
      <i>SourceCRS</i> being the more local, or child coordinate
      reference system, and the <i>TargetCRS</i> being the more
      remote or parent coordinate reference system, in
      the special case the coordinate operation between the local
      engineering coordinate system of the construction project
      and any map or other coordinate reference system.

<ul>
<li><u>Profile</u>: a three-dimensional closed curve within a

parameter of the parametric door representation. The profile around
the edges of the opening is used to apply the door lining and door
panel shape parameter.</li>
<li><u>MappedRepresentation</u>: A SweptSolid, SurfaceModel, Brep
or a CSG representation additionally defining the 3D shape of the

interrupted by a landing). The stair steps and any stringers are
included in the stair flight. A winder is also regarded a part of
a stair flight.</p>
<p>An <span class="self-ref">IfcStairFlight</span> is normally aggregated by an
<strong>IfcStair</strong> through the <strong>IfcRelAggregates</strong> relationship,
the stair flight is then included in the set of

normally connects the floor slab of zero to two different storeys
(or partial storeys, or landings) within a building. The
connection relationship between the <span class="self-ref">IfcStairFlight</span> and the
<strong>IfcSlab</strong> is expressed using the
<strong>IfcRelConnectsElements</strong> relationship.</p>



<p>Currently, the 'Axis', 'FootPrint', 'Body', and 'Box'
representations are supported. The 'Box' representation includes
the representation type 'BoundingBox' and is explained at

<h1>IfcDistributionControlElement</h1>
                                
                                <p>The distribution element <span class="self-ref">IfcDistributionControlElement</span> defines occurrence elements of a building automation control system that are used to impart control over elements of a distribution system.</p>

<p><span class="self-ref">IfcDistributionControlElement</span> defines elements of a building automation control system. These are typically used to control distribution system elements to maintain  variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure, flow, power, or lighting levels, through the modulation, staging or sequencing of mechanical or electrical devices. The three general functional categories of control elements are as follows:</p>

<ul> 
<li>Impart control over flow control elements (<strong>IfcFlowController</strong>) in a distribution system such as dampers, valves, or relays, typically through the use of actuation (<strong>IfcActuator</strong>).</li>
<li>Sensing elements (<strong>IfcSensor</strong>) that measure changes in the controlled variable such as temperature, humidity, pressure, or flow.</li>
<li>Controllers (<strong>IfcController</strong>) typically classified according to the control action they seek to perform and generally responsible for making decisions about the elements under control.</li>
</ul>
    
<p>Since <span class="self-ref">IfcDistributionControlElement</span> and its subtypes typically relate to many different distribution flow elements (<strong>IfcDistributionFlowElement</strong>), the objectified relationship <strong>IfcRelFlowControlElements</strong> has been provided to relate control and flow elements as required.</p>

<p>The key distinction between <strong>IfcDistributionFlowElement</strong> and <span class="self-ref">IfcDistributionControlElement</span> is whether it is internal or external to the flow system, respectively. For example, the distinction between <strong>IfcFlowMeter</strong> (subtype of <strong>IfcDistributionFlowElement</strong> measuring a flow quantity) and <strong>IfcFlowInstrument</strong> (subtype of <span class="self-ref">IfcDistributionControlElement</span> measuring a flow quality), is based on this principal.  A physical device that connects within the flow system in which it measures (having inlet/outlet pipes for the measured substance) follows the <strong>IfcDistributionFlowElement</strong> hierarchy (and therefore <strong>IfcFlowMeter</strong> which measures the flow internally).  Otherwise, if it monitors/controls but does not connect inline within the flow system (it is external or is a component of another device), then it follows the <span class="self-ref">IfcDistributionControlElement</span> hierarchy (and therefore <strong>IfcFlowInstrument</strong> which may display various attributes through connected sensors).</p>

                                <p>A distribution port is an inlet or outlet of a product through which a particular substance may flow.</p>
 
<p>Distribution ports are used for passage of solid, liquid, or gas substances, as well as electricity for power or communications.  Flow segments (pipes, ducts, cables) may be used to connect ports across products.  Distribution ports are defined by system type and flow direction such that for two ports to be connected, they must share the same system type and have opposite flow directions (one side being a <i>SOURCE</i> and the other being a <i>SINK</i>).  Ports are similar to openings in that they do not have any visible geometry; such geometry is captured at the shape representation of the enclosing element or element type.  Ports may have placement that indicates the position and orientation of the connection.</p>

                                <p>A distribution system is a network designed to receive, store, maintain, distribute, or control the flow of a distribution media.

<p>The group <span class="self-ref">IfcDistributionSystem</span>

<ul><li>From <strong>IfcGroup</strong> it inherits the inverse attribute <i>IsGroupedBy</i>, pointing to the relationship entity <strong>IfcRelAssignsToGroup</strong>.

<ul><li>From <strong>IfcObject</strong> it inherits the inverse attribute <i>IsDecomposedBy</i> pointing to the relationship entity <strong>IfcRelAggregates</strong>.

<p>A flow terminal type is used to define the common properties of a flow terminal that may be applied to many occurrences of that type.  A flow terminal acts as a terminus or beginning element in a distribution system such as a ceiling register in a ducted air distribution system, a sink in a waste-water system, or a light fixture in an electrical lighting system. Flow terminal types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.</p>

It is applied to <strong>IfcDistributionFlowElement</strong> and <strong>IfcDistributionControlElement</strong>.</p>

<p>This relationship may be used to indicate an operational relationship such as an actuator operating a valve, damper, or switch.  It may also be used to indicate a sensing relationship such as a sensor detecting conditions of fluid flow.</p>

An element component is a representation for minor items included in, added to or connecting to or between
   elements, which usually are not of interest from the overall building structure viewpoint.
   However, these small parts may have vital and load carrying functions within the construction.
   These items do not provide any actual space boundaries.
   Typical examples of <span class="self-ref">IfcElementComponent</span>s include different kinds of fasteners and various accessories.
</p>

<p>One or several instances of subtypes of <span class="self-ref">IfcElementComponent</span> should always be accompanied by a defining instance of a respective subtype of <strong>IfcElementComponentType</strong>.  The type object holds shape and material information.</p>




<p>It is often desirable to model a number of same-shaped element components by means of a single
occurrence object, e.g. several bolts within a connection or a row of reinforcement elements.
In this IFC release, this is possible by means of multiple mapped representation as documented below.</p>

<p>To express the multiplicity of element components also on a higher semantic level,
a <i>Qto_ElementComponentPatternQuantities</i> should be provided via <strong>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</strong>
and contain the number of pieces which are placed by a single <span class="self-ref">IfcElementComponent</span> instance.</p>

<p class="use-head"><b>Symbolic Representation</b></p>

<p>A symbolic representation is defined for a row of components or several rows of
components within a single instance of <span class="self-ref">IfcElementComponent</span>.  Such rows or arrays may
contain possibly large numbers of individual pieces.  The product definition shape consists of
an <strong>IfcShapeRepresentation</strong> with the attribute values</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i> : 'Row'</li>
  <li><i>RepresentationType</i> : 'GeometricCurveSet'</li>
</ul>
<p>and one or several curves as geometric items.  The curves represent where reference points of
the pieces are located.  For example, such reference points may be at the heads of mechanical fasteners
or at the starting point of the extrusion axis of reinforcement bars.  In case of straight components
(bolts, nails, staples, straight reinforcement bars, or similar), the local placement of the
<span class="self-ref">IfcElementComponent</span> shall be located and oriented such that the local z axis is parallel with
the axes of the components.  A <i>Qto_ElementComponentPatternQuantities</i> should denote the count

with <strong>IfcClassificationReference</strong> should be used.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>IfcClassificationReference.Identification</i>
contains a machine-readable form of the formal fastener designation from the norm.
Example: 'M16X80-10.9-HV' for a high-strength structural bolting assembly for preloading with
hexagon bolt and nut.  (On the other hand, <i>IfcMechanicalFastenerType.Name</i> contains a
displayable name which may not necessarily be the same as the formal designation.)</li>
<li><i>IfcClassificationReference.Name</i> carries the short name of the fastener norm.
Example: 'EN 14399-4' as the respective European standard for high-strength hexagon bolts.</li>
<li>Optionally, the norm can be further described by

<p>An asset is generally the level of granularity at which maintenance operations are undertaken. An asset is a group that can contain one or more elements. Whilst the financial value of a component or element can be defined, financial value is also defined for accounting purposes at the level of the asset.<br/>  <br/>There are a number of actors that can be associated with an asset, each actor having a role. Actors within the scope of the project are indicated using the <strong>IfcRelAssignsToActor</strong> relationship in which case roles should be defined through the <strong>IfcActorRole</strong> class; otherwise principal actors are identified as attributes of the class. In the existence of both, direct attributes take precedence.<br/>  <br/>There are a number of costs that can be associated with an asset, each cost having a role. These are specified through the <i>OriginalValue</i>, <i>CurrentValue</i>, <i>TotalReplacementCost</i> and <i>DepreciatedValue</i> attributes.</p>

                                <p>An inventory is a list of items within an enterprise.</p> 
 
<p>Various types of inventory can be included. These are identified by the range of values within the inventory type enumeration which includes space, asset, and furniture. User defined inventories can also be defined for lists of particular types of element such as may be required in operating and maintenance instructions. Such inventories should be constrained to contain a list of elements of a restricted type.<br/><br/>There are a number of actors that can be associated with an inventory, each actor having a role. Actors within the scope of the project are indicated using the <strong>IfcRelAssignsToActor</strong> relationship in which case roles should be defined through the <strong>IfcActorRole</strong> class; otherwise principal actors are identified as attributes of the class. In the existence of both, direct attributes take precedence.<br/><br/>There are a number of costs that can be associated with an inventory, each cost having a role. These are specified through the <i>CurrentValue</i> and <i>OriginalValue</i> attributes.</p>

                                <p>An occupant is a type of actor that defines the form of occupancy of a property.</p> 
 
<p>The principal purpose of <b>IfcOccupant</b> is to determine the nature of occupancy of a property for a particular actor. All characteristics relating to the actor (name and organization details) are inherited from the <strong>IfcActor</strong> entity.</p>

                                <p>A request is the act or instance of asking for something, such as a request for information, bid submission, or performance of work.</p>

                                <p>An <span class="self-ref">IfcCostItem</span> describes a cost or financial value together with descriptive information that describes its context in a form that enables it to be used within a cost schedule. An <span class="self-ref">IfcCostItem</span> can be used to represent the cost of goods and services, the execution of works by a process, lifecycle cost and more.</p>

<p>Each instance of <span class="self-ref">IfcCostItem</span> may have a name and a description. Depending on the use for which the cost is intended, these values should be asserted on the basis of agreement. For instance, the <i>Name</i> attribute could be used to provide a common value that enables distinct instances to be brought together in a nesting arrangement (see below) while the </i>Description</i> attribute may be used to provide text used for item description in a costing schedule.</p>

<p>An <span class="self-ref">IfcCostItem</span> can link one or many <strong>IfcCostValue</strong>'s representing a unit cost, total cost, or a unit cost with one or many quantities used to generate the total cost. The quantities can be given as individual quantities, or those quantities are provided as element quantities by one or many building elements.  The <i>IfcCostValue.CostType</i> attribute indicates the category of cost, which may be used to present the value in a particular column.  For nested cost items (having <strong>IfcRelNests</strong> relationship), <i>IfcCostValue.CostType</i> is significant such that <i>IfcCostValue.AppliedValue</i> is calculated as the sum of all nested costs having the same <i>IfcCostValue.CostType</i> or if set to an asterisk ('*'), then the sum of all nested costs of all cost types. An <strong>IfcCostValue</strong> may represent an original value or a value derived from formulas using <i>IfcAppliedValueRelationship</i>.  For example, taxes may be calculated as a percentage of a subtotal.</p>

                                <p>A structural action is a structural activity that acts upon
a structural item or building element.</p>





<p class="use-head">Relationship use definition</p>
<p>Structural actions are grouped into either an <strong>IfcStructuralLoadGroup</strong> of predefined
type LOAD_GROUP or, more often, an <strong>IfcStructuralLoadCase</strong>.  This is accomplished via the
inverse relationship <i>HasAssignments</i> and an <strong>IfcRelAssignsToGroup</strong> relationship object.
<i>IfcStructuralLoadGroup.LoadGroupFor</i> or <i>IfcStructuralLoadCase.LoadGroupFor</i> respectively
refers to the structural analysis model(s) in which the loads are used.</p>

<p>It is furthermore possible to establish relationships between actions in one analysis model
and reactions in another analysis model which cause the actions.  For example, a support reaction
from one structural system may be taken over as a load onto another supporting structural system.
This is expressed by means of the inverse relationship <i>ReferencedBy</i> of the action and an
<strong>IfcRelAssignsToProduct</strong> relationship object.  <i>IfcRelAssignsToProduct.Name</i> is set to
'Causes' and <i>IfcRelAssignsToProduct.RelatedObjects</i> refers to an instance of a subtype of
<strong>IfcStructuralReaction</strong>.</p>

<h1>IfcStructuralActivity</h1>
                                
                                <p>The abstract entity <span class="self-ref">IfcStructuralActivity</span> combines the definition of actions (such as forces, displacements, etc.) and reactions (support reactions, internal forces, deflections, etc.) which are specified by using the basic load definitions from the <i>IfcStructuralLoadResource</i>.</p>

<p>The differentiation between actions and reactions is realized by instantiating objects either from subclasses of <strong>IfcStructuralAction</strong> or <strong>IfcStructuralReaction</strong> respectively.  They inherit commonly needed attributes from the abstract superclass <span class="self-ref">IfcStructuralActivity</span>, notably the relationship which connects actions or reactions with connections, analysis members, or elements (subtypes of <strong>IfcStructuralItem</strong> or <strong>IfcElement</strong>).</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; The semantics of <span class="self-ref">IfcStructuralActivity</span> are only fully defined

<p><b><u>Coordinate Systems</u></b>:</p>

<p>The following coordinate systems are distinguished:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The so-called global coordinate system is the coordinate system shared by all items and activities which are grouped in a common <strong>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</strong>.  This coordinate system is established by an <i>ObjectPlacement</i>.  (This coordinate system is not necessarily the same as the <strong>IfcProject</strong>'s world coordinate system.)</li>
  <li>The so-called local coordinate system is a coordinate system local to a structural item (connection or member).  This coordinate system is established by a <i>Representation</i> in conjunction with further use definitions and attributes of subtypes of <strong>IfcStructuralItem</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Representation items in topology representations are always given within the <i>ObjectPlacement</i>, i.e. in so-called global coordinates (global with respect to the <strong>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</strong> to which this activity belongs).</i>

<p>Locations of the load objects in the <i>AppliedLoad</i> attribute (if of type <strong>IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration</strong>) are always given in local coordinates.</p>

<p>Directions of the load objects in the <i>AppliedLoad</i> attribute refer to global or local coordinates according to the <i>GlobalOrLocal</i> attribute.</p>

<p>The <i>ObjectPlacement</i> and <i>Representation</i> are sometimes not explicitly instantiated; instead they may be implied as described below.  Global and local coordinate systems are then determined in the same way as with explicit placement and representation.</p>

<p><b><u>Topology Use Definitions</u></b>:</p>

<p>Instances of <span class="self-ref">IfcStructuralActivity</span> which are connected with a structural item of same dimensionality, i.e.</p>
<ul>
  <li>a point action or reaction connected with a point item (<strong>IfcStructuralPointConnection</strong>),</li>
  <li>a curve action or reaction connected with a curve item (<strong>IfcStructuralCurveConnection</strong>, <strong>IfcStructuralCurveMember</strong>), or</li>
  <li>a surface action or reaction connected with a surface item (<strong>IfcStructuralSurfaceConnection</strong>, <strong>IfcStructuralSurfaceMember</strong>) and which acts on the entire surface of the item and is not specified by isocontours</li>
</ul>

<p>Important functionalities for the description of an analysis model are derived from existing IFC entities:</p>

  <li>From <strong>IfcGroup</strong> it inherits the inverse attribute <i>IsGroupedBy</i>, pointing to the relationship class <strong>IfcRelAssignsToGroup</strong>.

      <blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp;  Loads (as instances of <strong>IfcStructuralAction</strong>) are not included through <i>IsGroupedBy</i>.  Loads are assigned through the <i>LoadedBy</i> attribute relationship, using load groups as a grouping mechanism.

  </li>
  <li>From <strong>IfcObject</strong> it inherits the inverse attribute <i>IsDecomposedBy</i> pointing to the relationship class <strong>IfcRelNests</strong>. It provides the hierarchy between the separate (partial) analysis models.</li>
</ul>





<p class="spec-head">Informal Propositions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If one or more structural item (instance of a subtype of <strong>IfcStructuralItem</strong>) is grouped into an <span class="self-ref">IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</span>, the attribute <i>SharedPlacement</i> shall be provided with a value.</li>

A closed shell is a shell of the dimensionality 2 which typically serves as a bound for a region in R3. A
closed shell has no boundary, and has non-zero finite extent. If the shell has a domain with coordinate space R3, it divides that space into two connected
regions, one finite and the other infinite. In this case, the topological normal of the shell is defined as being directed from the finite to the
infinite region. <br><br> 
The shell is represented by a collection of faces. The domain of the shell, if present, contains all those faces, together with their bounds.
Associated with each face in the shell is a logical value which indicates whether the face normal agrees with (TRUE) or is opposed to (FALSE) the shell
normal. The logical value can be applied directly as a BOOLEAN attribute of an oriented face, or be defaulted to TRUE if the shell boundary attribute member
is a face without the orientation attribute. <br><br> 
The combinatorial restrictions on closed shells and geometrical restrictions on their domains are designed to ensure that any domain associated
with a closed shell is a closed, orientable manifold. The domain of a closed shell, if present, is a connected, closed, oriented 2-manifold. It is always
topologically equivalent to an <i>H</i>-fold torus for some <i>H</i> &ge; 0. The number <i>H</i> is referred to as the
surface genus of the shell. If a shell of genus <i>H</i> has a domain within coordinate space <i>R<sup>3</sup></i>, then the finite region of space inside
it is topologically equivalent to a solid ball with <i>H</i> tunnels drilled through it.<br><br> 
The Euler equation applies with <i>B</i>=0, because in this case there are no holes. As in the case of open shells, the surface genus <i>H</i>
may not be known a priori, but shall be an integer &ge; 0. Thus a necessary, but not sufficient, condition
for a well-formed closed shell is the following:

An edge is the topological construct corresponding to the connection of two
vertices. More abstractly, it may stand for a logical relationship between two vertices. The domain of an edge, if
present, is a finite, non-self-intersecting open curve in <i>R<sup>M</sup></i>, that is, a connected 1-dimensional
manifold. The bounds of an edge are two vertices, which need not be distinct. The edge is oriented by choosing its traversal
direction to run from the first to the second vertex. If the two vertices are the same, the edge is a self loop. The domain of the
edge does not include its bounds, and 0 &le; &Xi; &le; &infin;. Associated with an edge may be a geometric curve to locate the
edge in a coordinate space; this is represented by the edge curve subtype. The curve shall be finite and non-self-intersecting within 
the domain of the edge. An edge is a graph, so its multiplicity M and graph genus <i>G<sup>e</sup></i> may be determined by the 
graph traversal algorithm. Since <i>M</i> = <i>E</i> = 1, the Euler equation (1) reduces in the case to:
<blockquote><img src="../../../figures/IfcEdge-Math1.gif" width="105" height="24"></blockquote>

An edge curve is a special subtype of edge which has its geometry fully defined. The geometry is defined by associating the edge with a curve
which may be unbounded. As the topological and geometric directions may be opposed, an indicator (same sense) is used to

agrees with (TRUE) or is in the opposite direction (FALSE) to the edge direction. Any geometry associated with the vertices of the
edge shall be consistent with the edge geometry. Multiple edges can reference the same curve.

A face is a topological entity of dimensionality 2 corresponding to the intuitive notion of a piece of
surface bounded by loops. Its domain, if present, is an oriented, connected, finite 2-manifold in <i>R<sup>m</sup></i>. A face domain shall not have handles
but it may have holes, each hole bounded by a loop. The domain of the underlying geometry of the face, if present, does not contain its bounds, and 0
&lt; &Xi; &lt; &infin;.<br><br> 
A face is represented by its bounding loops, which are defined as face bounds. A face has a topological normal n and the tangent to a loop is t. For a
loop bounding a face with defined geometry, the cross product n x t points
toward the interior of the face. That is, each loop runs counter-clockwise
around the face when viewed from above, if we consider the normal n to point
up. With each loop is associated a BOOLEAN flag to signify whether the loop
direction is oriented with respect to the face normal (TRUE) or should be
reversed (FALSE). <br><br> 
A face shall have at least one bound, and the loops shall not intersect. One loop is optionally distinguished as the outer loop of the face. If so, it
establishes a preferred way of embedding the face domain in the plane, in which the other bounding loops of the face are inside the outer bound. Because the
face domain is arcwise connected, no inner loop will contain any other loop. This is true regardless of which embedding in the plane is chosen. <br><br> 
The edges and vertices referenced by the loops of a face form a graph, of which the individual loops are the connected components. The Euler equation (1) 
for this graph becomes:
<blockquote>

A face surface is a subtype of face in which the geometry is defined by an associated surface. The portion of the surface used by the face shall be
embeddable in the plane as an open disk, possibly with holes. However, the union of the face with the edges and vertices of its bounding loops need not be
embeddable in the plane. It may, for example, cover an entire sphere or torus. As both a face and a geometric surface have defined normal directions, a
BOOLEAN flag (the orientation attribute) is used to indicate whether the surface normal agrees with (TRUE) or is opposed to (FALSE) the face normal
direction. The geometry associated with any component of the loops of the face shall be consistent with the surface geometry, in the sense that the domains of
all the vertex points and edge curves are contained in the face geometry surface. A surface may be referenced by more than one face surface.</blockquote>

A loop is a topological entity constructed from a single vertex, or by stringing together connected
(oriented) edges, or linear segments beginning and ending at the same vertex. It is typically used to bound a face lying on a surface. A loop has
dimensionality of 0 or 1. The domain of a 0-dimensional loop is a single point. The domain of a 1-dimensional loop is a connected, oriented curve, but need not
to be manifold. As the loop is a circle, the location of its beginning/ending point is arbitrary. The domain of the loop includes its bounds, an 0 &le; &Xi;
&lt; &infin;. 
A loop is represented by a single vertex, or by an ordered collection of oriented edges, or by an ordered collection of points. A loop is a graph, so
<i>M</i> and the graph genus <i>G<sup>l</sup></i> may be determined by the graph traversal algorithm. Since <i>M</i> = 1, the Euler equation (1) reduces
in this case to

where <i>V</i> and <i>E<sub>l</sub></i> are the number of unique vertices and oriented edges in the loop and <i>G<sup>l</sup></i> is the genus of the loop.

An open shell is a shell of the dimensionality 2. Its domain, if present, is a finite, connected, oriented,
2-manifold with boundary, but is not a closed surface. It can be thought of as a closed shell with one or more holes punched in it. The domain of an open
shell satisfies 0 &lt; &Xi; &lt; 1. An open shell is functionally more general than a face because its domain can have handles.
<br><br> 
The shell is defined by a collection of faces, which may be oriented faces. The sense of each face, after taking account of the orientation, shall
agree with the shell normal as defined below. The orientation can be supplied directly as a BOOLEAN attribute of an oriented face, or be defaulted to TRUE if
the shell member is a face without the orientation attribute.
<br><br>
The following combinatorial restrictions on open shells and geometrical restrictions on their domains are designed, together with the informal
propositions, to ensure that any domain associated with an open shell is an orientable manifold.
<ul> 
 <li class="extDef">Each face reference shall be unique. </li> 
 <li class="extDef">An open shell shall have at least one face. </li> 
 <li class="extDef">A given face may exist in more than one open shell.</li> 
</ul>
<br>
The boundary of an open shell consists of the edges that are referenced only once by the face - bounds (loops) of its faces, together with all of their
vertices. The domain of an open shell, if present, contains all edges and vertices of its faces.
<br>
<br>
NOTE&nbsp; Note that this is slightly different from the definition of a face domain, which includes none of its bounds. For example, a
face domain may exclude an isolated point or line segment. An open shell domain may not. (See the algorithm for computing below.)

Except for perhaps orientation, the oriented edge is equivalent to the original edge.

A common practice is solid modelling systems is to have an entity that represents the "use" or "traversal" of an edge.
